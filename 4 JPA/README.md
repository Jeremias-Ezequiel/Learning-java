# Java Persistence API (JPA)

JPA is an ORM (Object Relationa Mapping) framework that aims to achieve data persistence between a Java application and a database. 

JPA translates the modeling of Java classes into relational modeling in a database, allowing the programmer to choose which classes or objects to persist. 

# How does JPA work? 

JPA relies on a series of mappings that must be applied to each element of a class, which are represented through annotations ( @ ).

JPA has several providers, including Eclipselink, Hibernate, Toplink, and others.
